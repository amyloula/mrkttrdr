     TaskMatch provides a unique, innovative, community­based online outsourcing service. A failure by you

to provide information requested by us may mean that We are unable to provide some or all of our 

services to you.<br><br>

TaskMatch collects personal information when you register with TaskMatch. This may include, but is not 

limited to, your name, address, phone number, contact details, birth date, gender, credit card and account 

details, occupation and interests. We might also give you the option of providing a photo or video to be 

associated with your TaskMatch user ID. If your personal details change, it is your responsibility to update 

your TaskMatch account with those changes, so that We can keep our records complete, accurate and 

up to date.<br><br>

You are not anonymous to us when you log into the Site or post any content (including tasks, items to be 

supplied, bids, comments or feedback) on the Site or any associated forum. To enable us to improve our 

existing services and to create new service features, TaskMatch may collect, and share with other users 

and service providers on TaskMatch, information about the way you use our services, including (but not 

limited to) the transactions you enter into on the Site, your feedback rating (including any references 

requested using our ‘Reference’ feature), the bids you make, the comments you post, and the 

transactions you enter into with our valued affiliate service providers.<br><br>

When you:

● use the Site to post a task or item to be supplied, or make a bid, or comment on a bid, or 

provide feedback on other users; or

● otherwise communicate in a public forum on the Site,

your user ID and all the material that you post is visible to other TaskMatch users and is also publicly 

available to other internet users. We strongly encourage you to use caution and discretion when posting. 

TaskMatch does not in any way control, and does not accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for, 

the disclosure or use of personal information which is voluntarily posted by you in any publicly accessible 

area of the Site.<br><br>

TaskMatch may also receive and record information from your internet browser and computer, including 

IP addresses, cookies (see section 2 below), software and hardware attributes and your page requests.

In addition to data collected from your submissions, we may also collect data on your internet behavior 

from Facebook, other social media sites, and other services. If you use a location­ enabled TaskMatch 

service, We may collect and process information about your actual location (for example, GPS signals 

sent by your mobile device). We may also use a range of different technologies to confirm your location.<br><br>

TaskMatch may use the information collected by it to provide the TaskMatch Services, including (but not 

limited to):

● identification and authentication;

● to protect TaskMatch and the users of the Site;

● to customise the content and any advertising displayed on the Site;

● to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services;

● providing your information to a user with whom you have or had a contract facilitated by 

TaskMatch;

● as required by law, order of a court, tribunal or regulator or if TaskMatch reasonably believes 

that the use or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary for enforcement related 

activities;

● to develop new service features;

● to ensure that TaskMatch receives payment of the fees due to it;

● to contact you (for example, to inform you about upcoming changes or improvements to our 

services);

● to conduct research;

● to permit content on the Site (such as postings or third party advertisements) to be targeted, 

on an aggregate basis, to the users for whom it is most likely to be relevant;

● to expand our user base;

● to develop our relationships with affiliate service providers; and

● to generate data reports on an aggregated, non­personally identifiable basis, for both internal 

and third party use, but subject to any applicable laws (for example, We may show 

advertisers or investors trends relating to the general use of TaskMatch’s services).

Your contact information may also be used for accounting, invoicing and billing purposes, marketing 

purposes, by third party service providers to TaskMatch, and to respond to any enquiry you make, in 

some cases information we collect is transferred overseas. When you contact TaskMatch, We may keep 

a record of the communication(s) between you and TaskMatch to help resolve any issues you might 

have. If other user(s) of the Site already have your userID (or other information identifying you), and you 

have chosen to upload a photo or other personal information to your TaskMatch account, We may show 

those user(s) that personal information.<br><br>

In certain circumstances We will use your email address to administer our User Agreement (for example, 

We may notify you of a breach, or action a request for a Take Down Notice in response to a claim of 

copyright infringement).
