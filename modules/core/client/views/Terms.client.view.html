Posted Tasks are subject to further terms set out for Posting Tasks and Making Offers below.<br><br>
3.A TaskMatch Worker with an ability to perform services and/or to provide the goods (1) creates an account with TaskMatch and (2) reviews Posted Tasks uploaded by Job Posters.<br><br>
4.If a TaskMatch Worker desires to provide services or sell goods to a Job Poster, the TaskMatch Worker must make an offer in response to the Posted Task ("Offer"). By making an Offer the TaskMatch Worker confirms that s/he is legally entitled to and capable of supplying the goods or services described in the Posted Task. Offers are subject to further terms set out for Posting Tasks and Making Offers below.<br><br>
5.If a Job Poster in any way updates a Posted Task after it has been published on the TaskMatch Platform and before an offer has been accepted, then TaskMatch may, at its discretion, cancel all Offers for that Posted Task that were made prior to the update and recommence the offer process.<br><br>
6.If the Job Poster agrees to a TaskMatch Worker’s offer, the Job Poster will accept that TaskMatch Worker’s Offer by using the functionality on the TaskMatch Platform and paying the agreed price into the payment facility escrow account accessible via the TaskMatch Platform ("Escrow Account").<br><br>
7.The TaskMatch Worker and Job Poster use a public question and answer feature on the TaskMatch Platform to communicate directly about posted requests for services or goods. Once a Job Poster has accepted an offer from a TaskMatch Worker, the Job Poster and the TaskMatch Worker can communicate privately using a TaskMatch private messaging service. Each time a TaskMatch User receives a message from the TaskMatch messaging service, a notification may be sent to the User via their currently active communication channel.<br><br>
8.Once a Job Poster has accepted an offer from a TaskMatch Worker and paid the agreed price into the Escrow Account then the Job Poster and the TaskMatch Worker will be deemed to have entered into a separate contract under which the Job Poster agrees to purchase, and the Buyer agrees to provide the Job Poster with the services or goods ("Task Contract").<br><br>
9.The terms of the Task Contract incorporate the terms of this Agreement (to the extent they apply to the Job Poster and the TaskMatch Worker) and any additional terms and conditions agreed between the Job Poster and the TaskMatch Worker, including the description and price of the services or goods to be provided.

11.Once a TaskMatch Worker has provided the goods or services requested by a Job Poster in accordance with the Task Contract, the TaskMatch Worker must provide notice that the task is complete by using the TaskMatch Platform functionality. It will be material breach of this Agreement and the Task Contract if a TaskMatch Worker provides notice that a task is complete for a particular Posted Task without having provided the relevant goods or services.

13.Once the Job Poster has released the payment, the fee will be paid from the Escrow Account to the TaskMatch Worker after the deduction of the relevant fees set out in the Service Fee Schedule and described in Fees below ("Service Fees").<br><br>

16.TaskMatch may from time to time include on the TaskMatch Platform a “Hire Me” feature which enables TaskMatch Users who are browsing other User profiles to post a request for goods and services based on the skills, reputation or other profile attributes of a particular User. When this occurs, the TaskMatch User who the Job Poster would like to make an Offer will be automatically notified (i) of the new Posted Task, and (ii) that the Job Poster would like him/ her to make an Offer to supply the goods or services.
